# tap.test.apha-game
This is the alpha game used to test connecting to the Tap Platform
Name: Not gonna work (uniques sense of humour, I know :-) 

#Todo
- complete the final check-out button
- integrate both tap protocols to integrate with game point table
- game is still alpha so needs lots of polishing :-)
